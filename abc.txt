Hello,

Thank you for your interest in MagicDraw.

I would suggest to you to not create multiple satisfy relationships. 

Instead of it, create only one satisfy relationship between system and grouping requirement

So can create only one satisfy between system and grouping requirement and all other satisfies get by using implied relation.

Please let us know if this answers your question.

Waiting for your response,
