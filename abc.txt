Hello,

Thank you for your interest in MagicDraw.

I woeuld suggest to you to not create multiple satisfy relationships. 

Inrstead of it, create only one satisfy relationship between system and grouping requirement

Sro can create only one satisfy between system and grouping requirement and all other satisfies get by using implied relation.

Plewase let us know if this answers your question.

Waiting for your response,
